Good planning of functionality - didn't actually refer back to it

Could have used first failed test as a driver to create the Shop class
Good use of TDD - run test, fix problem, run test, fix problem, run test, fix problem, run test, make test green!

Used string documentation to look at what is available
Good use of IRB to test functionality - could have just used [A-Z]?

Could have added a second (or more) tests to drive out the proper code rather than jumping to it. Simpler solution?

Naming convention - "c"?

Good use of p to see what is going on

When trying to fix error about integer not being able to convert to a string, error was pointing towards the .chars, started to look for different problem. Quickly found the right answer, but did you check the error line number?

Good guard clause as simplest way to solve a scenario.

When moving on to delivering the correct results, could have returned 100 as hardcoded as the simplest possible answer to start with. Then could have moved on to just A in the hash etc.

Very quickly found the problem with total. Could have explained it aloud so I could tell how you got there?
Looked like you were looking at the wrong error for a very short while

Good use of their test cases as a starting point, could you have added any others?

Good refactoring to use subject instead of Shop.new each time
